# 100DaysOfRust
A simplified Guide for 100DaysOfRust challenge to improve rustlang skills.

Day 1-10: Start by familiarizing yourself with the basics of the Rust programming language. You can do this by going through the official Rust book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), which covers topics such as variables, data types, control flow, and functions.

Day 11-20: Once you have a basic understanding of Rust, move on to learning about ownership and borrowing. These concepts are unique to Rust and are essential to writing safe and efficient code. The Rust book covers these topics in depth.

Day 21-30: Learn about the standard library and common patterns used in Rust. The standard library provides a lot of functionality that you can use in your own projects, such as strings, collections, and I/O. Additionally, learn about common patterns such as error handling, iterators, and macros.

Day 31-40: Start working on a small project in Rust to put your newfound knowledge into practice. This will help you solidify your understanding of the language and its features.

Day 41-50: Learn about advanced features such as generics, traits, and lifetime. These features allow you to write more flexible and reusable code.

Day 51-60: Learn about Rust's macro system. Macros allow you to write code that generates code, which can be a powerful tool for code generation, metaprogramming, and more.

Day 61-70: Learn about Rust's support for concurrent and parallel programming. Rust provides powerful abstractions for concurrent and parallel programming, such as threads, channels, and the rayon library.

Day 71-80: Learn about Rust's support for FFI (Foreign Function Interface) and how to use Rust code from other languages and use other languages code from Rust.

Day 81-90: Learn about Rust's WebAssembly support and how to use Rust to build web applications.

Day 91-100: Continue to work on personal projects and seek out resources online to further your understanding of Rust and its ecosystem. Additionally, consider joining a local Rust meetup or online community to connect with other Rust developers and learn from them.
